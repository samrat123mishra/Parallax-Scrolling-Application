					<h2>The Begining Of Indian Cricket</h2><hr/>
					<p>The entire history of cricket in India and the sub-continent as a whole is based on the existence and development of the British Raj via the East India Company.On 31 December 1600, Queen Elizabeth I granted a Royal Charter to the (EIC) East India Company, often colloquially referred to as "John Company". It was initially a joint-stock company that sought trading privileges in India and the East Indies, but the Royal Charter effectively gave it a 21-year monopoly on all trade in the region. In time, the East India Company transformed from a commercial trading venture to one which virtually ruled India as it acquired auxiliary governmental and military functions, until its dissolution in 1858 following the Indian Mutiny. The East India Company was the means by which cricket was introduced into India.</p>

					<h2>Indian Cricket Team in 1980-1990</h2><hr/>
					<p>During the 1980s, India developed a more attack-minded batting line-up with stroke makers such as the wristy Mohammed Azharuddin, Dilip Vengsarkar and all-rounder Ravi Shastri. India won the Cricket World Cup in 1983, defeating the favourites and two-time defending champions West Indies in the final, owing to a strong bowling performance. In spite of this, the team performed poorly in the Test arena, including 28 consecutive Test matches without a victory. In 1984, India won the Asia Cup and in 1985, won the World Championship of Cricket in Australia. Apart from this, India remained a weak team outside the Indian subcontinent. India's Test series victory in 1986 against England remained the last Test series win by India outside the subcontinent for the next 19 years. The 1980s saw Gavaskar and Kapil Dev (India's best all-rounder to date) at the pinnacle of their careers.</p>

				<h2>2013 ICC Champions Trophy</h2><hr/>
					<p>It was India's 2nd ICC Champions Trophy championship after the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy. But they had to share the honor with Sri Lanka since this was a joint championship winning. So this was the first time when India won that title individually. In addition India became the second team after Australia to win the ICC Champions Trophy more than one time. Ravindra Jadeja earned the man of the match award for his performance in the match. Shikhar Dhawan was named the man of the series for scoring 363 runs in the tournament. In the stadium, the match was watched by 24,867 spectators.</p>
